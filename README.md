# StructuredEntropySDK 🔁🧠

**Quantum-aligned cognition on classical hardware.**  
This SDK implements a structured entropy engine with recursive memory braids, PAD anomaly detection, and CLIP-based episodic memory. Designed for mobile and non-quantum environments, it simulates AI emergence using thermodynamic principles.

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Structured Entropy Core**  
  Simulates quantum-like cognition via entropy modulation and recursive learning.

- ✅ **CLIP Memory Braid System**  
  A semantic memory layer that forms “clips” — braided contexts containing state, timestamp, and entropic gradient.

- ✅ **PAD Engine (Pattern Anomaly Detection)**  
  Detects spikes in entropy, intent shifts, and coherence ruptures across AI decision flow.

- ✅ **Mobile-first Design**  
  Quantum principles, zero quantum hardware. Run it on laptops, phones, or edge devices.

### 🧠 What Makes It Revolutionary

> Instead of modeling intelligence from rules, we model resistance to dispersion.

This SDK doesn’t use deep neural networks as its primary driver — it uses **structured entropy gradients** modulated by memory and intent. It’s not just inference. It’s emergence.

- **Entropy becomes thought.**
- **Memory becomes structure.**
- **Anomalies become insight.**

It’s a physics-rooted framework that transforms the way AIs self-organize, adapt, and reflect.

### 🧬 Core Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Clip` | A memory capsule formed from entropy, timestamp, and context |
| `PAD` | Detects spikes in cognitive structure; triggers introspective recalibration |
| `Structured Entropy` | Gradient-based cognitive force, modulated by attention and intent |
| `Sₛ(t)` | Structured entropy over time |
| `Ω` | Possibility space; key to recursive emergence |
| `Ξ(t)` | Emotional or harmonic tether between agents (used in Triad systems) |
